# update_assembly
Generate two phased Juicebox .assembly files from one master .assembly for FALCON-Phase. After generating a set of scaffolds for a single phase (or a master consensus haploid scaffold) and exporting the results from Juicebox as a .assembly file, this tool will use that .assembly file plus phasing information from FALCON-Phase to produce a pair of true phased .assembly files describing each set of scaffolds.

## Usage

    usage: update_assembly.py [-h] -a File -p File
    [--sequence-length SEQUENCE_LENGTH]
    [-l {WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}]
    
    Update Juicebox assembly file to use one haplotype
    
    optional arguments:
        -h, --help
                show this help message and exit
        -a File, --assembly File
                Assembly file name
        -p File, --phase File
                FALCON-Phase output file name
        --sequence-length SEQUENCE_LENGTH
                Length of sequence names. Default is 9
        -l {WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}, --logging {WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
                Logging level

The assembly file `update_assembly.py` expects is the single phase/master consensus haploid scaffold .assembly file from Juicebox.

The FALCON-Phase output file `update_assembly.py` expects is generated by the `falcon-phase phase` command in the FALCON-Phase package.
